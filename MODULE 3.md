# Module 3

### Learning Goals

- The DOM
  - Mutate the DOM and its styles using JavaScript
  - Create new DOM nodes and append them
  - Use different querySelectors to select single or multiple elements

- JavaScripts
  - Identify common syntax differences between Ruby and JavaScript
    - String interpolation
    - No symbols
    - Everything is more explicit
      - parenthesis, curly braces, etc.
  - Explain the difference beween referencing and invoking a function
  - Explain how JavaScript will find the value of a variable based on scope
  - Define variable hoisting

- Events
  - Use `addEventListener` to invoke a callback function after an event
  - Explain the difference between bubbling and capturing events
  - Use `event.preventDefault` to override a form submission
  - Explain why to use an event listener on `DOMContentLoaded`
- Asynchronous Programming
  - Describe asynchronous programming
  - Explain how callback functions are used to manage asynchronous programming
  - Explain how promises are used to manage asynchronous programming
- Communicating with the Server
  - Describe the uses of a backend in the context of web applications
  - Use fetch to retrieve data from a server and display the results in the DOM
  - Exaplain what it means for `fetch` to run Asynchronously
  - Use fetch to send data to a server
- Rails API
  - Render JSON data from a Rails controller
  - Using `json:` to render ActiveRecord instances
  - Explain CORS and how to implement it in a Rails App
  - Render JSON data that includes associated entities
- What the Heck is `this`?
  - Determine the value of `this` based on how a function is defined and invoked
  - Change the value of `this` within a function using the arrow-function syntax
- Classes
  - Implement a class with the `class` and `constructor` keywords, and instantiate it with the `new` keyword
  - Explain when and why to use class methods
  - Implement a class which inherits from another using the `extends` keyword
- JavaScript Applications
  - Focus on the methodology of using tools to build an app
- Higher Order Functions
  - Use callbacks with common iterators like `map` and `filter`
  - Use currying to dynamically create basic functions like selectors
  - Describe functional, object oriented, and procedural paradigms
- JavaScript Tooling
  - Define NPM, Babel, and JSX as tools for developing with JavaScript
  - Use WebPack's Import Syntax to distribute code in multiple files
  - Use public class fields to define instance properties without a constructor
  - Use `create-react-app` to setup Babel, WebPack, and JSX for you


### Code Challenge Rubric

#### DOM Manipulation

1. Did not properly render elements to the DOM.

2. Rendered elements to the DOM, but with some errors.

3. Successfully rendered and updated the DOM as described by the Core Deliverables.

4. Structured HTML creation code cleanly and in a reusable way, using a semantically correct HTML structure without any unnecessary elements.

5. All of the above, plus completed at least one Advanced Deliverable.

#### Events

1. Did not attach event listeners to respond to events.

2. Attached event listeners, but incompletely or with some errors.

3. Successfully attached event listeners to handle DOM events and met all of the Core Deliverables.

4. Structured code in a clean and reusable way, splitting functions, using descriptive names and using target properties effectively.

5. All of the above, plus completed at least one Advanced Deliverable.

#### Communication with the Server

1. Unable to communicate with the server.

2. Partially able to communicate with the server, but incompletely or with some errors.

3. Able to perform a GET and a non-GET request successfully. All Core Deliverables met.

4. Code structured in a clean and reusable way, splitting into functions and reusing them where needed, with clear function and variable naming.

5. All of the above, plus completed at least one Advanced Deliverable.
