# Data Structures

**Time: 1:30** 

**FormativeEducation Deck:** https://formative.education/projects/3/edit>


### Learning Goals:

- Describe structures with hashes and arrays

- Use `each` to run code for every element in an array

- Create functions

- Use a methodology to solve problems


### Activation 

##### Time: 0:00

Given a stack of playing cards, write a list of instructions (in plain english) that would guide me to find the highest numbered card from the stack.

Work with three to four other people to come up with a list of instructions.



### Learning Goal 1: Describe structures with hashes and arrays

##### Time: 0:20

##### Demonstrate 

* Data Structures (not Voldemort)
* Difference between normal variables and containers
* Difference between hashes and arrays



### Learning Goal 2: Use `each` to run code for every element in an array

##### Time: 0:30

##### Demonstrate
- How `if` statements work
- Identifying repetition in solving a problem
- The name of `| x |` doesn't matter!!!



### Learning Goal 3: Create functions

##### Time: 0:50

##### Demonstrate

- Differentiate between **defining** and **invoking**
- Difference between "puts" and "return"
- Names of functions don't really matter
- arguments
  - with and without parenthesis
- hashes as arguments


### Learning Goal 4: Use a methodology to solve problems

##### Time: 1:10

##### Demonstrate

* Questions:
  * What data do I have?
  * How would I solve the problem with my own hands / mind? 
    * Make the problem as tangible as possible!
  * What steps would I give a small child so that they could solve this problem?
  * If there are too many steps, could I break the problem into smaller problems with multiple functions?
  * Where can I log things to see what the computer is thinking?
  * How can I interpert the output?



##### Vocabulary
- string / symbols / numbers
  - literal values that can be concattenated, shown to users, etc
- hashes
  - containers for other variables
- arrays
  - a container for **unenumerated** elements
- `if/else`
  - a statement which can split the "flow" of your code in two directions
- `each`
  - a tool to cause the same block of code to run multiple times
- function
  - re-useable piece of code
  - it is given arguments, which it will call parameters, and gives back a **return value**
- Single responsibility principle
  - Every function should be responsible for no more than one thing
