### Learning Goals

- Define SQL and Schema
- Use Foreign Keys to Associate Table Rows
- Access a SQL database from Ruby

### Activation

- Demo a test app. Our data doesnt persist...
- Once we persist our data it's going to stack up
- When our data stacks up **performance matters**
- Tracing the time complexity of a simple ruby process



### Learning Goal 1: Manipulate and retrieve data with SQL

##### Timestamp: 0:15

##### Demonstrate

- SQL 
  - A language for querying data (Structured Query Language)
- Query
  - A question
- A SQL database is a tool that helps us ask questions about our data
- DB Browser for SQLite
- Schema
  - The shape of our data
  - array -> table, object -> row, instance variable -> column

##### Vocabulary
