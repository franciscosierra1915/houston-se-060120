# ActiveRecord


### Resources
* https://create.kahoot.it/share/intro-to-activerecord/2e202ffe-b427-44b8-bc65-614d07e66be3



### Learning Goals

* Recognize the components of a conventional ActiveRecord environment
* Use ActiveRecord migrations to create and update a data schema
* Use ActiveRecord models to manipulate data



### Activation

* Demonstrate building a mini ORM
* If we kept adding features and kept adding features and kept adding features, we would be able to do everything we need to do with SQL, using plain ruby code
  * That's what ActiveRecord is, a set of tools that let us write ruby, and writes SQL for us in the background
