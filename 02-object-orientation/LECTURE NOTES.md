**Time: 1:30** 

**FormativeEducation Deck:** <https://formative.education/projects/5/edit>


### Learning Goals

- Create a class and instance
- Create instance methods
- Create instance variables
- Use the `initialize` method to set inital values for instance variables 


### Activation

##### Time: 0:00

What if we wanted **two** animals that could **both** have their own sounds?

Our logic is closely related to our data- we want to combine it

Objects are a combination of data and logic



### Learning Goal 1: Create a class and instance

##### Time: 0:10

##### Demonstrate

- Objects and classes are different
- Classes have a `new` method which creates an object of that _type_

##### Vocabulary

- Class
- Object

##### Questions 



### Learning Goal 2: Create instance methods

##### Time: 0:25

##### Demonstrate

- Instance methods can't be accessed directly
- You access them through a method of an instance

##### Questions 



### Learning Goal 3: Create instance variables

##### Time: 0:45

##### Demonstrate

- Instance variables can be accessed _anywhere_ inside of an instance
- Defining instance variables
- Using a fake `init`
- How `initialize` runs automatically

##### Questions 



### Learning Goal 4: Use the `initialize` method to set inital values for instance variables 

##### Time: 1:10

##### Demonstrate

* Passing arguments to `initalize`

##### Questions 

### Vocabulary
- Object
	- A data structure that contains both data _and_ behavior
- Class
	- A template of the data and behavior that a _type_ of object should have
- Instance Method
	- A function (behavior) attached to a specific object
- Instance Variable
	- A variable (data) attached to a specific object
- `initialize`
	- An instance method which runs automatically when an object is created
